# Multibot
AHk script for handling RosBot party on greater rifts
(for now only works with 2 bots)

1st, Open the Server:
Server needs to run as admin and run after rosbot process is up (dont start the sequence yet), then you select rosb process, logs.txt
and choose a port number, then click update

2nd, run the Client:
Client Needs to be party leader and then connect to Server IP and Port, then 
just start RosBot GR sequence


LogPath is the path to logs.txt from rosbot documents

Both need OpenGreaterRift to yes, but Server will determine the level,
the Client only accepts

Both need Overlay on and Full Logs

Put ramaladnis on last tab with many spaces, cuz they bug when tab is full cuz they dont stack
Set your vendoritemcount to 20 and kadala shards to something low that also won't overflow at the
end of the rift, that is also problematic (will cause them to fail and restart).

Turn off Firewall or add the Port u are using to exceptions on Firewall if they cant connect


Tested resolutions:
