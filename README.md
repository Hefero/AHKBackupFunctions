# Multibot
AHk script for handling RosBot party on greater rifts
(for now only works with 2 bots)

Go to the Wiki section for configuration with Screenshots and detailed info.

This script uses TCP/IP Server/Client Ip/Port Communication for telling each other to Pause/Unpause at right moments and to both go to menu and restart if one of them Fails the run.

It reads the Logs.txt from rosbot to determine current steps and some ImageReading for going back to menu
